👋 Hello world, I’m @Jsellers1977
  
👀 I’m interested in web development, UX, and outdoor recreation. I believe that the best websites and applications are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly. I love exploring the combination of technology and design to create amazing user experiences.

🌱 Currently, I am actively learning React, Electron, and User Experience Design Fundamentals. React is a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, while Electron allows developers to build desktop applications using web technologies. By expanding my knowledge in these areas, I aim to enhance my skillset and create innovative and efficient digital solutions.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on open-source projects. Working with a team of talented developers allows me to learn from others, contribute to meaningful projects, and make a positive impact in the tech community. I believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of sharing knowledge and expertise with others.

📫 If you'd like to reach me, feel free to contact me at info@jssofwarerdevelopment.com. I am always open to connecting with fellow developers, designers, or anyone who shares similar interests. Let's explore new opportunities, learn from each other, and create something awesome together!
